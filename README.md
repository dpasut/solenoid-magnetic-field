# This project finds the magnetic field lines of a solenoid.

## Variables that can be changed

* `gs` - grid spacing 
* `R` - Radius of loop (mm)
* `wr` - Radius of wire (mm)
* `p` - Pitch of wire, centre-to-centre (mm)
* `N` - Number of segments in single loop of wire
* `n` - Number of loops of wire
* `mu` - Magnetic suceptibility
* `I` - Current

## Plots

By default, the curve of the wire is plotted and saved in both `jpg` and `svg` formats. After the field lines are generated, they are plotted again in both `jpg` and `svg` formats. 

## Running the code

`Python 3.*.*` s required.
